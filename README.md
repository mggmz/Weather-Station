# Weather-Station
Compact IoT weather-station that uses a Particle Photon + DHT11 to stream temperature and humidity to Firebase Realtime Database; a lightweight web dashboard built with HTML + Tailwind CSS + Chart.js visualises the data in real time while an on-board red LED gives local over-temperature alerts.
